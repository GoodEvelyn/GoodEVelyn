	<div class="title">An Unexpected Call</div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>As I drifted off into a languorous afternoon nap, the intrusive chime of my phone shattered my reverie on its fifth ring. I struggled to pry open one eye and fumbled for the nightstand, still lost in the haze of drowsiness.</p>
        <p>The call was from a foreign number, located in Chongqing - a city I held dear, despite the 800 kilometers that separated us. The familiarity of the place and the distance made me feel a sense of belonging, but the caller was unknown to me.</p>
        <p>“Hello, who is this?” I rasped, clearing my throat and attempting to sound composed.</p>
        <p>“How have you been recently?” came the voice on the other end, unfamiliar and yet insistent.</p>
        <p>Silence was my only response, but the stranger continued, “Hello? Can you hear me?”</p>
        <p>“Um...can you tell me who you are first?” I managed to ask, my voice still mired in a fog of grogginess.</p>
        <p>“Damn it, you fucking woman who took my virginity forget about who I am,” came the unexpected reply, jarring me from my stupor. </p>
        <p>My mind was flooded with memories of this man I had encountered years ago. His words were as loathsome as ever, and the memories he evoked were unpleasant enough to rob me of any courage to continue the conversation.</p>
        <p>And so, I hung up without hesitation, the sound of the phone echoing in my ears as I bolted upright, fully awake.</p>
        <p>The voice on the other end of the line had conjured up a vivid image of the man who had once been a part of my life. I pictured his permed, hazy blue hair, slender, metal-rimmed eyes, and tight, matte lips with a moderate color. His words and mannerisms were as disagreeable as ever, a stark contrast to his previous demeanor in bed.</p>
        <p>And yet, despite the unpleasantness of the call and the man it brought to my mind, I couldn't help but remember that he was a 20-year-old virgin when we first made love. I, on the other hand, was a 20-year-old non-virgin. But my memory was limited to that one encounter, and nothing more.</p>
        <p>The scattered moans and touches coalesced into complete images in my mind, and just as I was about to press the play button on my memories, another unexpected phone call broke in.</p>
        <p>I suspected it was from the previous caller and cursed inwardly. “Damn it, can’t I just spend some time with my youthful sex before the sun sets? What's the fucking difference between calling now and spying on someone masturbating? Idiot.”</p>
        <p>After considering my options, I decided to:</p>
        <p><a href="1.1.html"> 1. Answer the call and curse him out right away. </a></p>
        <p><a href="1.2.html"> 2. Hang up and call back later to curse him out. </a></p>
