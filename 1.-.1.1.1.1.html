	<div class="title">The Anmesiac Butterfly</div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>We arrived at the Nan’an district quickly, and finally parked smoothly next to an apartment building on Nanbin Road.</p>
        <p>Along the way, I was plagued by constantly flashing memories in my mind, to the point that when he opened the door to his home, my mind was still blank about the current situation.</p>
        <p>Dylan went to help me with my luggage.</p>
        <p>I looked around and carefully examined his life.</p>
        <p>Beside the living room was a laundry room with a huge floor-to-ceiling window that was not obstructed by any frames, through which you could see the beautiful river on the side of Nanbin Road. It was that river that originally gave me the idea of settling in Chongqing. At night, if you leaned on the railing on the other side of the river, you could enjoy the city silhouette generously presented to you by this city.</p>
        <p>Just as my thoughts were getting thicker, Dylan interrupted me and said, “Take a shower first. You can wear my clothes.”</p>
        <p>I “hmmed” and took the hoodie he handed me and walked towards the shower.</p>
        <p>I really needed a good shower.</p>
        <p>Water sprouted from the showerhead's holes, pouring onto my hair and body.</p>
        <p>Actually, I liked the feeling of kissing Dylan, and I liked his thoughtful performance on the bed and his meticulousness when we were together. But some mistakes had crept up between us, and these mistakes stood between us.</p>
        <p>The temperature of the water gave me a strong sense of security, which was unbreakable.</p>
        <p>The memories that were sporadically recalled were organized into a timeline. I met Dylan because of Mingie. After a year of acquaintance, he came to my city to travel and we had sex.</p>
        <p>But our first time together should not have been the only time.</p>
        <p>I wiped every corner of my body with body wash. When I reached my ankle, I paused because there should have been a butterfly tattoo there, but now it was gone.</p>
        <p>Where did it go? Only the scarred skin was left now.</p>
        <p>Some never-before-seen images suddenly came rushing in, but they weren't about the butterfly.</p>
        <p>In the image, I lay on the bed with my back to Dylan, and he embraced me from behind, tentatively touching my body. Then I was completely ignited and responded to him with the touch of my body.</p>
        <p>We hid under the covers. After he entered, he covered my mouth with his hand, and I had to breathe through my nose.</p>
        <p>His chest was against my spine, and he said to me, “When I hug you from behind, I seem to be able to feel your heartbeat.”</p>
        <p>He was wrong, because at that time my heart seemed to be eaten by countless ants, and it was beating extremely slowly. Tears did fall from the corners of my eyes and onto the bedsheet, but it wasn't because of physical pleasure, nor was it because of the pain in my ankle.</p>
        <p>Why? Where did the butterfly go?</p>
        <p>I slowly dried my body with a towel, put on my clothes, and walked out without blow-drying my hair. Dylan was sitting in front of his computer, typing away in his study.</p>
        <p>I approached him and gently moved his hands off the keyboard, then sat on his lap and began to kiss him. He didn’t seem surprised and withdrew his hands from work, placing one hand on my thigh and the other on my neck. The intensity increased, and he lifted me up and carried me towards the bedroom, with water droplets trickling down my hair.</p>
        <p>His room also had a huge floor-to-ceiling window, covering the entire wall. He put me down and pushed me against the window, with only a dim desk lamp outlining our figures in the window’s reflection.</p>
        <p>My chest and arms were pressed against the window, the cold temperature making me gasp, and Dylan entered me with more roughness than ever before. </p>
        <p>He thrust into me, but this time, I didn’t feel any pleasure. My nerves curled up in pain, and I looked at myself and him in the window's reflection. Another face appeared on the window, faintly visible, with red hair, heavy eye makeup, and rusty-red lips. It was the person I used to be, the one who didn’t mind being compared to her.</p>
        <p>In the window’s reflection, she smiled at me, muttering teasing curses under her breath. </p>
        <p>The butterfly that disappeared existed because of her.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, I removed the tattoo of the butterfly right after Mingie blocked me. After the laser gun burned my skin again and again, the butterfly’s shadow rotted away in my flesh, sinking into an ancient silence under my decayed skin. It was replaced by my uncontrollable breathing when making love with Dylan.</p>
        <p>I dare not look at myself and Dylan in the window’s reflection again, haunted by the butterfly’s guilt. I leaned my head against the glass, allowing tears to fall, and before they hit the ground, Dylan and I reached our orgasm together.</p>
        <p>Stories never involve just two people. After Dylan left my body, I collapsed onto the carpet, gazing at the night view of the city I loved, the man who settled down in the city I loved, and the glass that Mingie briefly appeared in before disappearing again. </p>
        <p>I felt a sharp pain in my ankle.</p>
