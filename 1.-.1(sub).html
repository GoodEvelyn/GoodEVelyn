	<div class="title">Do You Listen to Taylor Swift, Too?</div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Mingie was the coolest girl to hang out with, at least at this university.</p>
        <p>We used to smoke together, occasionally running into each other after class. We didn’t have a specific place to smoke together, but I knew she had many friends like that.</p>
        <p>One afternoon in the winter semester of our freshman year, we coincidentally met. She handed me a Marlboro Ice Blast, one hand pressing down the lighter, the other shielding the flame from the winter wind to keep the fire alive. Just then, four or five guys came walking towards us, all the kind of friends I mentioned who would smoke with Mingie.</p>
        <p>And that was the first time I met Dylan.</p>
        <p>He walked among the crowd with a distant expression on his face, holding a 1916 cigarette that was half-burned.</p>
        <p>So Mingie chuckled and greeted them. In just a few words, they arranged the time and place for the next drinking session.</p>
        <p>On that day, Mingie sent me a message inviting me to join their drinking party.</p>
        <p>I had just finished dancing, sweating profusely even though it was December. The moment I received the message, I didn't even have time to put on a jacket, hastily rushing downstairs in a black T-shirt.</p>
        <p>There were six of us, me, Mingie, and Dylan squeezed into the same car heading to the bar.</p>
        <p>Mingie and I discussed funny videos on TikTok, English Premier League games, and rock music we both liked. Dylan sat in the passenger seat, playing with his phone in silence, wearing AirPods that separated him from us and the world.</p>
        <p>After we arrived at the bar, we ordered two bottles of Chivas Regal and mixed them with iced tea.</p>
        <p>I sat with my back to the live band, holding hands with Mingie on the sofa. The middle and ring fingers of my other hand held a menthol burst bead from Esse, then I took a drag from my cigarette and blew it all in Mingie's face. She then laughed and patted my shoulder, cursing in her mouth. I stared at her grafted eyelashes, trying to see the eyes hidden beneath the dense lashes, but I failed. This was Mingie, no one could know what she was thinking.</p>
        <p>I was a little tipsy, but I liked to claim that I could hold my liquor. The consequence of doing so was that even when I was already slightly drunk, I had to pretend to be unaffected.
        <p>Under such circumstances, I lost a game of Truth or Dare. I chose Dare. Everyone cheered to see the only two women in the room kiss. So I turned to Mingie. I meant to say that I had never kissed a girl before. But Mingie simply pressed the back of my head with her hand and skillfully sucked on my lower lip. My brain shut down for a moment, then Mingie ended the kiss, taking away the taste of mint tobacco and the vanilla chocolate flavor of her lip gloss.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I drank one glass after another, and the taste of whiskey churned in my throat and stomach. After I lost count of how many glasses I had, I stumbled up from the couch and followed the crowd to find the restroom. Oh, I remembered someone asked me what I was doing when I got up, but I ignored him.</p>
        <p>The bar was filled with flickering candlelight, and people’s faces were blurry and dispersed in the dim light. One person became two people, and two people became one in turn.</p>
        <p>I still managed to find the restroom, which was unisex. I opened the stall door, used my hand to lift my hair to avoid getting vomit on it, and started to uncontrollably throw up into the toilet, splashing vomit everywhere. It was disgusting. After flushing, I opened the stall door and walked to the sink. The mirror reflected my pale and exhausted face. I forgot that I didn't wear makeup today. I regretted not putting on makeup before going to the mixed-sex drinking party with the last of my rationality. Then I leaned to the side and didn't know whose chest I hit, but I was confident that no one would want to take advantage of my makeup-free face.</p>
        <p>The person helped me back to our seat. Mingie was nowhere to be found. I asked the others where Mingie went, and they said she left with a guy who came to pick her up.</p>
        <p>I casually responded and sat back down to continue drinking. My stomach, which had been emptied, was now filled with energy again. My blood was screaming for more alcohol to soothe it.</p>
        <p>After we finished all the drinks, we ended the drinking party and waited outside the bar for a taxi to take us back to school.</p>
        <p>The December wind fiercely invaded my bare skin and seeped into my T-shirt. The cold wind mixed with alcohol hit my nerves. I saw a green belt on the side of the road and walked towards it.</p>
        <p>I really didn’t care about my hair anymore. If it got dirty, let it be. If it was disgusting, then it was disgusting.</p>
        <p>To be honest, at that moment, I suddenly remembered the last year of high school when I didn’t go to school anymore and spent every day in a bar. That year, I drank too much alcohol, to the point where when my mom took me to get a gastroscopy, the doctor said I had severe gastric erosion, and I wasn’t very surprised.</p>
        <p>At the flowerbed, I vomited until my heart hurt, and all the muscles in my body failed at that moment. I used all my strength to vomit the stomach acid that would burn my throat. When tears fell from my lower eyelids, I wanted to be a little more sober and feel how cold the December wind really was. So, with tears streaming down my face, I looked up and collided with a pair of deep brown eyes, cold, distant, and condescending.</p>
        <p>The owner of these eyes held my hair with one hand, had the other hand in his pocket, and didn’t even bend down.</p>
        <p>I reached out my hand to him, and he hesitated for a moment before pulling me up from the ground.</p>
        <p>The warmth from his palm made me suddenly realize that I must have looked like a complete mess in front of a stranger.</p>
        <p>But, who cares? So I pretended to be relaxed and started humming Taylor Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble.”</p>
        <p>“Do you like Taylor Swift too?” the person next to me asked.</p>
        <p>“Yeah, I started listening to her in middle school. At that time, everyone around me said that people who listened to Taylor Swift were losers,” I rubbed my hands together and blew a breath into them.</p>
        <p>“That’s…pretty cool.”</p>
        <p>“Is it?”</p>
        <p>“Yep.”</p>
        <p>After that evening, we tacitly avoided bringing up my embarrassing situation. It was only because of Taylor Swift that I had someone to talk to. We talked about literature, music, and movies. He showed me letters he wrote to his high school crush during class when he was supposed to be paying attention. I noticed that he had very nice handwriting.</p>
        <p>“Why didn’t you get her?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“I never really tried,” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Why not?”</p>
        <p>“I’ve never done anything like that before.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.”</p>
        <p>“If you met someone you really, really liked one day, I mean really, really, really liked, would you pursue them?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Maybe, I don’t know.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.”</p>
